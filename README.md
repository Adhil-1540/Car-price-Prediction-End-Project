# Car Price Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various car attributes such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. By applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, we aim to build an accurate predictive model. The project also explores different machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for price prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Car attributes**: Brand, model, year, engine type, fuel type, etc.
- **Numerical features**: Mileage, engine size, horsepower, etc.
- **Categorical features**: Transmission type, drivetrain, etc.
- **Target variable**: Car price
- **Data source**: Collected from publicly available automotive marketplaces
- **Dataset size**: Contains thousands of records for better generalization
- **Dataset file**: `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook **ML\_End Project\_Car price dataset.ipynb**.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess it, and train the model.
3. Evaluate the model performance using different metrics.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new car data.
5. Export the model for future use or integration into applications.

## Features & Methods

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, and outlier detection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, outliers, and feature importance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new meaningful features to enhance model performance and improving feature selection techniques.
- **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and R-squared score for model assessment.
- **Model Deployment**: Saving the trained model using joblib or pickle for later use.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy score, effectively predicting car prices based on historical data. Further improvements can be made by optimizing hyperparameters and incorporating additional features. The project also highlights key insights from data analysis, such as the most influential factors affecting car prices.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Deployment of the trained model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
